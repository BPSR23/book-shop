						<h1>Welcome to Bookshop!</h1>
						<p>Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
							<br>
							We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
							<br>
							As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time.</p>

								<p>The Northing Tramp
									<br>
									Edgar Wallace (Author)
									<br>
									<h2 class="mu-heading-title">Description</h2>
									<br>
									Her wedding day was so fraught with danger that she and her husband were forced to flee from the deadly menace that ruthlessly dogged their every move. She learned to avoid the man with the red beard and his swarthy knife-juggling companion. Above all, she feared and avoided Gussie, whose drawl and monocle gave him a deceptive appearance of meekness. Who were these three and who was her strange husband and what was the secret that spelled death between them?

											<h4>Chapter One</h4>
											<p>THE tramp looked to be less savoury than most tramps; and more dangerous. For he was playing with a serviceable automatic pistol, throwing it from one hand and catching it with the other, balancing its muzzle on his forefinger with an anxious eye as it leaned first one way and then another; or letting it slip through his hands until the barrel was pointing earthward.</p>

											</span>
											<h4>Chapter Two</h4>
											<p>MR. PFFIEFER was a stout man with a sense of humour; but since he was a lawyer having his dealings with a dour people who had one public joke which served the whole county when recited at Farmers' Conventions, and one private obscenity which, told in a smoky atmosphere 'twixt shuffle and cut, had convulsed generations of hearers, he never displayed the bubbling sense of fun that lay behind his pink mask of a face.</p>

											<h4>Chapter Three</h4>
											<p>MRS. ELMER made several visits to the bedroom. She had endeavoured throughout the day to arouse October to a sense of her responsibilities, but unsuccessfully.
												<br>
												"You'd break the heart of a stone," said Mrs. Elmer bitterly.</p>

											<h4>Chapter Four</h4>
											<p>AS OCTOBER crossed the porch she heard the roll of thunder. Hanging over the handrail was the old coat she used as a carpet when the shade of the apple trees enticed her out of doors. She gathered it mechanically.
												<br>
												Robin was walking ahead of her. She saw the nearly white sleeve of his tattered shirt and, quickening her pace, overtook him.</p>
